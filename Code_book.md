the code book modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following column variables:
=====================================================

`subject` data:
=============
are in the files 'subject_train.txt' or 'subject_test.txt'. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

features data, including:
============================
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

`activity` labels:
=================
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name, as follows:

* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING

datasets with quantitative training and test data with their corresponding labels:
=================================================================================
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

units:
======
- The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. 

- The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

following variables:
====================
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration `Acc`  and angular velocity `Gyro` were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude `Mag` of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
`t` at the beginning of the variable stands for time domain

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
`f` indicates frequency domain signals 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
the features are as follows and will be given descriptive names containing explanations from this section in tidy_data.
